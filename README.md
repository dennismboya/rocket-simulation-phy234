# Rocket Simulation – PHY234 Project

This repository contains the physics simulation code and project deliverables for the final project in PHY234: Classical Mechanics at Grinnell College.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project models the motion of a rocket launched under the influence of gravity and atmospheric drag. The objective was to simulate trajectory parameters using Newtonian mechanics, differential equations, and numerical integration in Python.
